        <h2>LOCAL LAWS; EXPORT CONTROL</h2>
        <p>
          We control and operate the Website from our headquarters in the United
          States of America and the entirety of the Website may not be
          appropriate or available for use in other locations. If you use the
          Website outside the United States of America, you are solely
          responsible for following applicable local laws. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
          AND ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER. Please Read This Provision
          Carefully. It Affects Your Legal Rights. This provision facilitates
          the prompt and efficient resolution of any dispute (with the exception
          of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below) that
          may arise between you and us. Effectively, then, “dispute” is given
          the broadest meaning enforceable by law and includes any claims
          against other parties relating to services or products provided or
          billed to you (such as our licensors, suppliers, dealers or
          third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the
          same proceeding. This provision provides that all disputes between you
          and us will be resolved by binding arbitration because acceptance of
          these Terms constitutes a waiver of your right to litigation claims
          and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. We prefer this
          because we believe arbitration is less drama-filled than litigation.
          To be clear, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court
          review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow
          this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court
          (including attorney’s fees). YOU AND {BrandName} AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS
          PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER
          PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN
          THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING
          ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.
        </p>
        <h2>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          For all disputes, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve the
          dispute which is first done by e-mailing us at support@{BrandName}.com
          the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a
          written description of your claim, and (4) a description of the
          specific relief you seek. If we do not resolve the dispute within 45
          days after receiving your notification, then you may pursue your
          dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only
          under the circumstances described below.
        </p>
        <h2>Arbitration Procedures</h2>
        <p>
          If this provision applies and the dispute is not resolved as provided
          above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or we may initiate
          arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),
          www.adr.org, or JAMS, www.jamsadr.com, will arbitrate all disputes,
          and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The
          arbitration will be commenced as an individual arbitration, and will
          in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. This provision
          governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration
          rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules
          apply to the arbitration. Because this Website and these Terms concern
          interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the
          arbitrability of all disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply
          applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable
          statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. You or we may
          initiate arbitration in either Georgia or the federal judicial
          district that includes your billing address. In the event that you
          select the latter, we may transfer the arbitration to Georgia so long
          as we agree to pay any additional fees or costs which the arbitrator
          determines you incur as a result of the transfer. So long as you place
          a request in writing prior to commencement of the arbitration, we will
          pay all arbitration fees and associated costs and expenses. But, you
          will still be responsible for all additional fees and costs that you
          incur in the arbitration which include but are not limited to
          attorneys’ fees or expert witnesses.
        </p>
        <h2>Class Action Waiver</h2>
        <p>
          Except as otherwise provided in this provision, the arbitrator may not
          consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise
          preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or
          claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private
          attorney general action) unless both you and {BrandName} specifically
          agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose
          to pursue your dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration
          Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply
          to you. Neither you, nor any other user of this Website can be a class
          representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class,
          consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied
          with the opt-out requirements above.
        </p>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
          You understand and agree that by accepting this provision in these
          Terms, you and we are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a
          trial before a judge in a public court. If any clause within this
          provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found
          to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this
          provision whose remainder will be given full force and effect. If the
          Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable,
          this entire provision will be unenforceable and the dispute will be
          decided by a court. This provision will survive the termination of
          your account with us or our affiliates and your discontinued use of
          this Website. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
          contrary, we agree that if we make any change to this provision (other
          than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change
          and require us to adhere to the language in this provision if a
          dispute between us arises.

        <h2>GENERAL TERMS</h2>
        <p>
          We think direct communication resolves most issues – if we feel that
          you are not complying with these Terms, we will likely tell you. We
          may even provide you with recommended necessary corrective action(s)
          if possible. However, certain violations of these Terms, as determined
          by us, may require immediate termination of your access to this
          Website without prior notice to you. The Federal Arbitration Act,
          Georgia state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to
          the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms to
          the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Except for disputes
          subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to
          these Terms or this Website will be heard in the courts located in
          Fulton County, Georgia. Except as otherwise set forth in the dispute
          resolution provision, if any of these Terms are deemed inconsistent
          with applicable law, then such term(s) will be interpreted to reflect
          the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. By
          choosing not to enforce any of these Terms, we are not waiving our
          rights. These Terms, together with our Privacy Policy, End User
          Agreement and the Data Processing Addendum (as applicable), contain
          the entire agreement between you and us and, therefore, supersede all
          prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements
          between {BrandName} and you about the Website and our services. The
          rights of {BrandName} under our Terms will survive the termination of
          our Terms.
        </p>
        <h2>CHANGES</h2>
        <p>
          We may amend our Terms at any time by publishing revised Terms on our
          Website and/or by sending an e-mail to the address you gave us. The
          latest copies of our Terms will be posted on our Website, and you
          should review all Terms prior to using our Website. Continued use of
          this Website following notice of any such modifications indicates you
          acknowledge and agree to be bound by the modifications. Therefore, it
          is important for you to periodically review our Terms to make sure you
          still agree to them. If you object to any such modifications, your
          sole recourse will be to cease using this Website. {BrandName}{' '}
          reserves the right to change any and all features of our Website, at
          any time without notice.
        </p>
